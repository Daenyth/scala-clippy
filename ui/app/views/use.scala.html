<p>
    Did you ever see a Scala compiler error such as:
</p>

<pre>
[error] TheNextFacebook.scala:16: type mismatch;
[error]  found   : akka.http.scaladsl.server.StandardRoute
[error]  required: akka.stream.scaladsl.Flow[akka.http.scaladsl.model.HttpRequest,akka.http.scaladsl.model.HttpResponse,Any]
[error]   Http().bindAndHandle(r, "localhost", 8080)
</pre>

<p>
    and had no idea what to do next? Well in this case, you need to provide an implicit instance of an <code>ActorMaterializer</code>,
    but the compiler isn't smart enough to be able to tell you that. Luckily, <strong>Scala Clippy is here to help</strong>!
</p>

<p>
    Just add the Scala Clippy compiler plugin, and you'll see this additional helpful message:
</p>

<pre>
[error]  Clippy advises: did you forget to define an implicit akka.stream.ActorMaterializer?
[error]  It allows routes to be converted into a flow.
[error]  You can read more at http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka-stream-and-http-experimental/2.0/scala/http/routing-dsl/index.html
</pre>

<h2>Adding the plugin</h2>

<p>
    In your SBT build file, add:
</p>

<pre>
addCompilerPlugin("com.softwaremill.clippy" % "plugin" % "0.1" cross CrossVersion.full)
</pre>

<p>
    Upon first use, the plugin will download the advice dataset from <code>https://scala-clippy.org</code> and store it
    in the <code>$HOME/.clippy</code> directory. The dataset will be updated at most once a day, in the background.
</p>
